# Step 1: Check Current Execution Policy
# Run the following command to check the current execution policy:
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
# This will show the policies applied at different scopes (e.g., LocalMachine, CurrentUser).

# Set the Execution Policy
# To allow scripts to run, set the execution policy to a less restrictive level. You can use:
# For the Current User (Recommended):
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
# RemoteSigned: Requires that scripts downloaded from the internet are signed by a trusted publisher.

# Step 3: Retry the Command
# After adjusting the policy, retry your command:
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
